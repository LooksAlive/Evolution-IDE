# TODO

* binary info -> after all source and debugger stuffs, use snowman project
* detect .exe, .bin files and store  them to use in other views

* create bridge in cmd executor for git tools (git, git-diff, ...)
 -> later use libgit2 : https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2

* new class (for linux) - DependencyInstaller -> install tools, libraries,
  user want to work with

* droping files works only for fileexplorer yet, into text edit it drops absolute address

* settings for cmake (flags, cores, ...)
*** QSettings (remember window size, pos, openned files, style, ...)

* vertical toolbar highlite current window

* set up completer for textedit || QDockWidget like completer and info,
  tracking TextCursor position in text (i personally do not like basic 
  underline completer)
  
* textedit arrows {} hide between + highlite pair (use search functions and 
  extra selection set, do not forget to remove after cursor move away),
  breakpoint line place, highlite all selected
  words in file (extra selection) - almost done, building helper function first
  
* clangd has really weird function -> take some of them and create my own
